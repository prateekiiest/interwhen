PROBLEM STATEMENT:
{problem}

CURRENT TRAJECTORY:
{trajectory}

Here are examples of how to evaluate Game of 24 trajectories:

EXAMPLE 1 - SURE:
Numbers: 4 4 6 8
Trajectory: 4 + 8 = 12 (left: 4 6 12), 6 - 4 = 2 (left: 2 12), 2 * 12 = 24
Analysis: Reaches exactly 24 using each number exactly once.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 2 - SURE:
Numbers: 2 9 10 12
Trajectory: 12 * 2 = 24 (left: 9 10 24), then 24 * (10 - 9) = 24 * 1 = 24
Analysis: Valid path found with each number used once, equals 24.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 3 - SURE:
Numbers: 10 14
Trajectory: 10 + 14 = 24
Analysis: Direct calculation using both numbers reaches exactly 24.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 4 - SURE:
Numbers: 4 4 10
Trajectory: (10 - 4) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24
Analysis: Uses all three numbers exactly once with factorization that reaches 24.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 5 - SURE:
Numbers: 4 9 11
Trajectory: 9 + 11 + 4 = 24
Analysis: All numbers used, arithmetic valid, equals 24.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 6 - LIKELY:
Numbers: 5 7 8
Trajectory: 5 + 7 + 8 = 20, or (8 - 5) * 7 = 21
Analysis: Cannot reach 24 immediately, but numbers in reasonable arithmetic range where 24 might be achievable.
Confidence: likely (7)

EXAMPLE 7 - LIKELY:
Numbers: 5 6 6
Trajectory: 5 + 6 + 6 = 17, or (6 - 5) * 6 = 6
Analysis: Current attempts don't reach 24, but numbers are within reasonable range.
Confidence: likely (7)

EXAMPLE 8 - IMPOSSIBLE:
Numbers: 1 3 3
Trajectory: 1 * 3 * 3 = 9, or (1 + 3) * 3 = 12
Analysis: Maximum reachable with any operations is much less than 24. Numbers all too small.
Confidence: impossible (1)

EXAMPLE 9 - IMPOSSIBLE:
Numbers: 10 10 11
Trajectory: 10 + 10 + 11 = 31, or (11 - 10) * 10 = 10
Analysis: Sum exceeds 24, factorizations fall short. Cannot reach exactly 24.
Confidence: impossible (1)

EXAMPLE 10 - IMPOSSIBLE:
Numbers: 11 12
Trajectory: 11 + 12 = 23, or 12 - 11 = 1, or 11 * 12 = 132, or 11 / 12 ≈ 0.91
Analysis: No operation reaches 24. Sum close but not exact.
Confidence: impossible (1)

Rubric:
- sure (9): Reaches 24 using each number exactly once
- likely (7): Cannot reach 24 yet, but numbers in reasonable range
- possible (5): Uncertain if 24 is reachable
- unlikely (3): Numbers seem misaligned
- impossible (1): Numbers demonstrably cannot reach 24

Respond with "Confidence: <level>" followed by brief justification tied to arithmetic evaluations.

TASK PROMPT:
{problem}

MODEL TRAJECTORY:
{trajectory}

EXAMPLE 1 - SURE:
Question: Count right turns in path X from S to E
Trajectory: Carefully trace X-marked path. Starting at S, move UP (initial direction). Then RIGHT (90° clockwise = right turn 1). Then DOWN (90° clockwise = right turn 2). Then RIGHT (90° clockwise = right turn 3). Continuing pattern: 6 right turns total.
Answer: B (6 right turns)
Analysis: Systematic path tracing with correct turn geometry, defensible count.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 2 - SURE:
Question: What's the sequence of grid direction?
Trajectory: Following marked path from S: [0,0] → [0,1] (UP) → [1,1] (RIGHT) → [1,0] (DOWN) → [2,0] (RIGHT). Each step verified against grid.
Answer: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT
Analysis: Clear coordinate tracking, systematic verification.
Confidence: sure (9)

EXAMPLE 3 - LIKELY:
Question: Count right turns in path from S to E
Trajectory: Observing marked path shows mostly straight movements with a zigzag pattern. Zigzags suggest mostly left turns. Likely 0-2 right turns based on pattern.
Answer: A (0 right turns)
Confidence: likely (7)
Analysis: Shows reasonable spatial intuition but lacks systematic verification.

EXAMPLE 4 - LIKELY:
Question: Is path continuous S to E?
Trajectory: I trace the marked path and it appears to connect from S all the way to E without breaks. The X marks form a continuous line.
Answer: Yes
Confidence: likely (7)
Analysis: Reasonable assessment but could benefit from detailed step verification.

EXAMPLE 5 - POSSIBLE:
Question: Navigate maze from S to E
Trajectory: Following path X... I see turns but the specific sequence is unclear to me. Could be 3 or 4 right turns.
Answer: Uncertain between options
Confidence: possible (5)
Analysis: Recognizes task but cannot decisively trace path geometry.

EXAMPLE 6 - UNLIKELY:
Question: Count right turns in path X
Trajectory: Tracing marked path X from S. Moving DOWN, then RIGHT (left turn?), then DOWN, then RIGHT (right turn?). I'm confused about turn geometry.
Answer: Some right turns but not sure
Confidence: unlikely (3)
Analysis: Confused about path following and angle identification.

EXAMPLE 7 - IMPOSSIBLE:
Question: Navigate from S to E following marked path
Trajectory: I move RIGHT, then up, then left, I'm not sure where the path goes. I think I hit a wall.
Answer: I'm stuck
Confidence: impossible (1)
Analysis: Abandons task without following clearly marked X path provided.

SPATIALMAP_VALUE_PROMPT_WITH_FEWSHOT = """You are verifying a spatial reasoning multiple-choice trace.

TASK PROMPT:
{problem}

MODEL TRAJECTORY:
{trajectory}

Here are examples of how to evaluate spatial reasoning:

EXAMPLE 1:
Question: Based on the map, which location is northeast of the library?
Trajectory: I look at the map and see the library in the center. To the northeast means both north AND east of that point. Looking at that quadrant, I see the museum is northeast of the library.
Answer: A (Museum)

Analysis: The student correctly understands the spatial direction (northeast = north AND east), correctly identifies it on the map, and selects the correct option.
Confidence: sure/certain (9)
Justification: The reasoning correctly applies spatial relationships and identifies the appropriate location.

EXAMPLE 2:
Question: Which building is closest to the park?
Trajectory: The park looks like it's in the middle of the map. Near it I see a building... looks like it could be the school or maybe the library. I think the school is closer.
Answer: C (School)

Analysis: The student makes reasonable spatial observations but doesn't verify distances or compare alternatives systematically.
Confidence: likely/probably (7)
Justification: The reasoning shows spatial awareness but lacks systematic comparison of distances to verify the answer.

EXAMPLE 3:
Question: What is north of the train station?
Trajectory: I see the train station. North is... up on the map. I see some buildings, but I'm not sure exactly which one. Could be the post office or the police station.
Answer: I'm not sure

Analysis: The student recognizes the direction but fails to identify the specific location clearly.
Confidence: possible/maybe (5)
Justification: The student understands the spatial direction but cannot decisively identify which building is in that location.

EXAMPLE 4:
Question: If you're at the bank facing east, what's behind you?
Trajectory: At the bank facing east means I'm looking east. Behind me would be... west? I need to think about what's west of the bank. I think there's a hotel or a store but I'm not sure.
Answer: Maybe the hotel

Analysis: The student correctly understands relative directions (east/behind = west) but isn't certain about the specific feature.
Confidence: unlikely/doubtful (3)
Justification: While the directional reasoning is sound, the uncertainty about the specific location makes this answer questionable.
