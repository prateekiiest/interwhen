# interwhen: Verifiable Reasoning with Language Models

interwhen is a test-time verification framework for language models that enforces correctness with respect to a set of verifiers. It is designed to improve *instance*-level reliability in reasoning systems, particularly in high-stakes domains where occasional errors are unacceptable.

While modern language models achieve high average performance, aggregate metrics obscure a critical limitation: even highly accurate systems may fail on individual instances. Such failures erode trust and limit deployment, while in domains such as law, healthcare and robotics, they undermine safety and can cause real harm. Ensuring correctness at the level of a single query remains an open challenge, especially in settings where formal task structure is limited or absent.

interwhen addresses the problem by providing a plug-and-play mechanism to improve instance-level reliability of any language model, which we call *verifier-guided reasoning*. Instead of verifying only the final output, the framework enables verification of intermediate reasoning traces during generation. When a violation is detected, the system can steer, revise, or halt generation. If no output is produced, the system abstains; if an output is produced, it satisfies the specified verifiers.


From a research perspective, interwhen makes two contributions.

**A New Axis for Test-Time Scaling**. Introduces verifier compute as an additional dimension of scaling at inference time. Rather than scaling model size or sampling alone, performance can be improved by allocating compute to structured verification.

**A Testbed for Verifier Development**. Enables systematic evaluation of verifier designs at inference time before incorporating them into training objectives (e.g., as reward models or critics).


A detailed discussion of interwhen, including how it was developed and tested, can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11202).

## Key Features
interwhen changes the inference pipeline of a language model by creating an auxiliary Monitor model that runs alongside the model and interacts with the model’s output to improve its quality. The Monitor agent reads the output of a language model in real time and calls necessary verifiers to check its validity. 

1. **Verification During Generation**. interwhen verifies reasoning traces as they are produced, without requiring external step extraction or structured decomposition. This allows the model to retain flexible reasoning strategies while remaining subject to correctness constraints.

2. **Asynchronous and Efficient Execution**. Verifiers are executed asynchronously and intervene only when violations are detected, minimizing inference overhead while preserving responsiveness.

3. **Unified Model–Verifier Interface**. The framework provides a general API for interaction between language models and different kind of verifiers. Based on the objectivity of a domain, verifiers can be symbolic, neuro-symbolic or even fully neural verifiers. They can operate on partial outputs,  final answers, or both. 

----------------

At a conceptual level, interwhen reframes reliability in language models:

> Instead of asking whether a model is accurate on average, we ask whether a particular output satisfies explicit, verifiable constraints.

By integrating verification directly into generation, interwhen provides a general mechanism for improving the soundness of reasoning systems without restricting model expressivity or requiring retraining.

## Verifier-guided Reasoning in Three Lines 
Running verifier-guided inference requires only a few lines of code: just specify the list of monitors to be used with a target LLM. Each monitor requires specifying the kind of verifier, when it should be invoked (e.g., each step or after a reflection token like 'Wait'), and the text pattern to intervene with. 

**Set up target LLM server**
```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 \
  --max-model-len 65536 \
  --port 8000 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8
```

**Generate answer enabled with given monitors**
```python
llm_server = init_llm_server("Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507", max_tokens=32768, port=8000)
stream_completion(
    prompt,
    llm_server=llm_server,
    monitors=(monitor = StepVerifierMazeMonitor.from_prompt(
                  prompt_text=user_prompt,
                  max_corrections=5,
                  name="maze_step_verifier"),
    ),
    async_execution=True
)
```
The above monitor is for Maze dataset, where a maze is given and questions are asked with respect to the maze. We use metaprompting to get the output in the required format that can be parsed by the verifier. The above code implements a simple monitor that watches the model's output stream and verifies if the step proposed by the model is valid or not. You can run the full example:
```bash
python ./examples/TTSwithVerification/maze_stepverifier.py).
```

This is the visualization of the verification running to solve the Maze problem.

## Installation

**Clone repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/interwhen.git
cd interwhen
```
It is recommended to setup a fresh environment before installing the library.

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Test installation**
Run the following script to reproduce the text replacement example from above. 

```bash
python ./examples/text_replacement_example.py
```

## Examples

### Test-time verification 
We provide examples using three datasets: Maze, Game of 24, and SpatialMap. 

```bash
python ./examples/TTSwithVerification/[your_dataset]_stepverifier.py -n 1 # dataset=maze,game24, or spatialmap
```


For using TreeofThought

```bash
python ./examples/TTSwithVerification/tot_baseline.py \
  --task maze \
  --num_examples 4 \
  --ports 8000,8001,8002,8003 \
  --concurrency 4 \
  --model Qwen/QwQ-32B \
  --max_tokens 32768 \
```

This script loads the same datasets as the verification examples, spins up `TreeOfThoughtSearch` with configurable branching/depth, and round-robins requests across multiple vLLM instances for faster experimentation.

### Monitors for Early stopping
```bash
python ./examples/EarlyStopping/[your_dataset]_example.py -n 1
```

## Available Monitors

interwhen includes two families of monitors:
### Test-Time Verification Monitors

Improve reasoning accuracy by verifying intermediate steps and injecting corrective feedback when errors are detected.

| Monitor | Domain | Verifier |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **StepVerifierGame24Monitor** | Game of 24 | Arithmetic validation of each step's operation and remaining numbers |
| **StepVerifierMazeMonitor** | Maze navigation | Grid-based verification of moves, turns, and position tracking |
| **StepVerifierSpatialMapMonitor** | Spatial reasoning | Z3 constraint solver for directional relationship claims |

📖 **[Full documentation and parameter reference →](./examples/TTSwithVerification/README.md)**

### Early Stopping Monitors

Reduce inference cost by detecting when the model has reached sufficient confidence and terminating generation early.

| Monitor | Strategy | Key Parameter |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **EAT** | Entropy variance of next-token drops below threshold | `delta` (EMA variance threshold) |
| **DEER** | Geometric mean answer confidence exceeds threshold | `threshold` (confidence threshold) |
| **KstableAnswerMCQMonitor** | Same MCQ answer appears `k` consecutive times | `k`, `options` |
| **KstableAnswerGame24Monitor** | Same equation appears `k` consecutive times | `k`, `expected_nums` |

## Creating custom verifiers and monitors
You can create your own custom monitors by subclassing `VerifyMonitor` in `interwhen/monitors/base.py`. A custom monitor requires implementing three methods:

- **`step_extractor(chunk, generated_text)`** — Determines *when* to intervene by detecting meaningful reasoning steps in the model's streaming output. Returns a boolean indicating whether a new step has been identified and should be verified.
- **`verify(chunk, token_index, event, event_info)`** — Checks the correctness of the extracted step using domain-specific logic (symbolic solvers, rule checks, etc.) and signals whether a correction is needed.
- **`fix(generated_text, event_info)`** — Constructs the corrective feedback that is injected into the model's generation stream to steer it back on track.

## Intended Uses
- interwhen was developed to improve the quality of a reasoning model’s outputs without requiring finetuning.
- interwhen is best suited for tasks where verification is feasible, such as math, code reasoning, or structured document generation—not highly subjective tasks like creative writing or open-ended opinion pieces where correctness cannot be formally defined. 
- interwhen is being shared with the research community to facilitate reproduction of our results and foster further research in this area.
- interwhen is intended to be used by domain experts who are independently capable of evaluating the quality of outputs before acting on them.

## Out-of-scope Uses
- interwhen is not well suited for subjective tasks where answer verification is harder (or more complex).
We do not recommend using interwhen in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. It is being released for research purposes.
- interwhen was not designed or evaluated for all possible downstream purposes. Developers should consider its inherent limitations as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness concerns specific to each intended downstream use.
- Without further testing and development, interwhen should not be used in sensitive domains where inaccurate outputs could suggest actions that lead to injury or negatively impact an individual's legal, financial, or life opportunities.
- We do not recommend using interwhen in the context of high-risk decision making (e.g. law enforcement, legal, finance, or healthcare).

## Evaluation
interwhen was evaluated on its ability to improve the reasoning quality of existing language models on benchmarks spanning planning, math, logic, and deep research.
A detailed discussion of our evaluation methods and results can be found in our [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/interwhen-a-generalizable-framework-for-verifiable-reasoning-with-test-time-monitors/).

### Evaluation Methods
We used accuracy and efficiency metrics to measure interwhen’s performance.
We compared the performance of interwhen against baseline methods such as tree-of-thought and tool calling using benchmarks such as Maze, SpatialEval, Game of 24, Verina and others.
The target model (the model whose reasoning performance was improved) used in our experiments varied by task and included models from Qwen2, Qwen3 and Phi-4 series.
In our experiments, we used models from Qwen2 and Qwen3 series as the auxiliary monitor model. Results may vary if interwhen is used with a different monitor model, based on its unique design, configuration and training.

### Evaluation Results
At a high level, we found that interwhen allows a plug-and-play solution for improving the accuracy (and/or) efficiency of language models. The accuracy improvement on various benchmarks is shown below. Depending on the goal, interwhen can improve the accuracy of a language model given a compute budget or improve the efficiency of the model at a given accuracy.

## Limitations
- interwhen was developed for research and experimental purposes. Further testing and validation are needed before considering its application in commercial or real-world scenarios.
- interwhen supports a human-feedback based monitor, however, such a monitor may not be feasible in situations where latency of the model’s output is a key consideration.
- interwhen was designed and tested using the English language. Performance in other languages may vary and should be assessed by someone who is both an expert in the expected outputs and a native speaker of that language.
- Outputs generated by AI may include factual errors, fabrication, or speculation. Users are responsible for assessing the accuracy of generated content. All decisions leveraging outputs of the system should be made with human oversight and not be based solely on system outputs.
- interwhen inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by the auxiliary monitor model, as chosen by the developer. Developers are advised to choose appropriate target and auxiliary LLMs carefully, depending on the intended use case.
- interwhen is a framework which can run with any language model preferred by a user. Users can specify the language model whose reasoning they want to improve (“target” model) and an auxiliary model that monitors the target model’s reasoning trace.
- interwhen inherits any biases, errors, or omissions characteristic of the training data of the language models used, which may be amplified by any AI-generated interpretations.
- There has not been a systematic effort to ensure that systems using interwhen are protected from security vulnerabilities such as indirect prompt injection attacks. Any systems using it should take proactive measures to harden their systems as appropriate.

## Best Practices
Better performance can be achieved by assessing the utility of included verifiers for your task and activating only the necessary ones.
We strongly encourage users to use LLMs/MLLMs that support robust Responsible AI mitigations, such as Azure Open AI (AOAI) services.
